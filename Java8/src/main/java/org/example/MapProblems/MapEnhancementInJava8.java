     *Certainly! In Java 8, there were several enhancements related to hash-based data structures, including **HashMap**. Let's explore these improvements:

  1. **Performance Improvement for HashMaps with Key Collisions**:
     - Prior to Java 8, the performance of **HashMap** could degrade significantly when there were hash collisions (i.e., multiple keys mapping to the same hash bucket).
     - In Java 8, a new strategy was introduced to handle collisions more efficiently.
     - Instead of using a simple linked list to store entries in the same hash bucket, Java 8 introduced a balanced tree structure for hash bins with a large number of colliding keys.
     - This change applies to **HashMap**, **LinkedHashMap**, and **ConcurrentHashMap**.
     - Note that this improvement does not affect the classic **Hashtable** class¬π¬≤.

  2. **Lambda Expressions and Streams Support**:
     - The Java Collections Framework was updated to support **lambda expressions**, **streams**, and **aggregate operations**.
     - You can now use lambda expressions to perform operations on collections more concisely and expressively.
     - Streams allow you to process data in a functional and declarative style, making it easier to work with collections.
     - Aggregate operations (such as `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, etc.) are available for collections, making code more readable and efficient¬π.

  3. **Other Enhancements**:
     - While the primary focus was on performance and functional programming, other enhancements were made across the Collections Framework.
     - These include new and improved APIs that take advantage of lambda expressions and streams.
     - For more details, you can refer to the official Java documentation on **Enhancements in Java SE 8**¬π.

  In summary, Java 8 brought significant improvements to hash-based data structures, making them more efficient and expressive. If you're working with collections, I recommend exploring lambda expressions and streams to simplify your code! üòäüöÄ¬π¬≥‚Å¥
